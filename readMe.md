Be gentle, it is my first time using Symfony.


**Recommended .env:**
````
APP_ENV=dev

APP_SECRET=a2292f0cd502bc9c814008785da85601

DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///%kernel.project_dir%/var/data.db"
````


### Important ###

- I would like to add a Middleware to ensure the request user is always admin

- I tend to add the function descriptions I used over the createGroup function in every function.

- I could not run the test to leave it some TDDish, time is ticking and I still have some things left.

## EVEN MORE IMPORTANT ##

- The database model and the UML design are saved in the Artifacts folder

Thank you =D

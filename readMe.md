Be gentle, it is my first time using Symfony.


I tend to add the function descriptions I used over the createGroup function in every function.


I could not run the test to leave it some TDDish, time is ticking and I still have some things left.

**Recommended .env:**

APP_ENV=dev

APP_SECRET=a2292f0cd502bc9c814008785da85601
